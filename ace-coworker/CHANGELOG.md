## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-18

### Added

- `ace-coworker` gem: prepared executor for the file-based lab, owner of
  `.ace-local/coworker/` (ADR-034).
- `start` command: loads and validates the prepared run config (role,
  instructions, start prompt, task, assignment, overseer, error rules) with
  field-specific errors, resolves the task in the worktree, verifies the
  assignment↔task match, resolves the instruction source (file or
  `wfi://`/`prompt://`/`tmpl://` via `ace-nav`), and renders the executor
  brief pinning `--assignment <id>`. Writes nothing; never guesses a
  substitute commission.
- `status` command: readiness query (absent config renders `not ready: …`,
  exit 0), assignment progress from `ace-assign status --format json`, and a
  deterministic completion verdict with remaining-work reasons.
- Documented start-config contract consumed by the L4 planner
  (`docs/usage.md`).
