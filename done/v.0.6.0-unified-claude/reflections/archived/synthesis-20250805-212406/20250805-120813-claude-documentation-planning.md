# Reflection: Claude Integration Documentation Task Planning

**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Context**: Planning task v.0.6.0+task.019 - Update Claude integration documentation
**Author**: Claude Code
**Type**: Standard

## What Went Well

- Clear behavioral specification in the draft task made it easy to understand the requirements
- Existing documentation patterns in dev-tools/docs/user/ provided excellent reference examples
- The separation between quickstart and detailed reference documentation is a well-established pattern
- Task structure with validation questions helped clarify the scope

## What Could Be Improved

- The current Claude integration documentation mixes quickstart and detailed reference content
- No existing handbook-claude-*.md documentation files in dev-tools/docs/user/
- Gem installation instructions in current documentation are incorrect (it's a git submodule)
- Cross-repository references need careful planning to avoid broken links

## Key Learnings

- Documentation should follow established patterns for consistency (e.g., llm-query.md structure)
- Separating quickstart from reference documentation improves user experience
- Each subcommand should have its own comprehensive documentation file
- Cross-repository documentation requires clear path references and maintenance strategy
- The plan-task workflow provides excellent structure for technical implementation planning

## Action Items

### Stop Doing

- Mixing quickstart and reference documentation in a single file
- Including incorrect installation instructions (gem install)
- Documenting all subcommands in one large file

### Continue Doing

- Following existing documentation patterns from dev-tools/docs/user/
- Using clear table of contents and section headers
- Including troubleshooting sections in documentation
- Providing realistic command examples

### Start Doing

- Creating separate documentation files for each handbook claude subcommand
- Establishing clear cross-references between quickstart and detailed docs
- Including validation commands in implementation plans
- Planning for documentation maintenance and updates

## Technical Details

The implementation plan includes:
- 5 new documentation files to be created in dev-tools/docs/user/
- 1 existing file to be transformed (dev-handbook/.integrations/claude/README.md)
- Consistent structure following the llm-query.md pattern
- Clear separation between quickstart (in dev-handbook) and reference (in dev-tools)

## Additional Context

- Task file: dev-taskflow/current/v.0.6.0-unified-claude/tasks/v.0.6.0+task.019-update-claude-integration-documentation.md
- Reference documentation pattern: dev-tools/docs/user/llm-query.md
- Current Claude integration docs: dev-handbook/.integrations/claude/README.md
