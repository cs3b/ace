# Reflection: Task 018 Documentation Update Completion

**Date**: 2025-08-02
**Context**: Completed task v.0.4.0+task.018 - Update documentation and workflow references
**Author**: Claude Code AI Agent
**Type**: Standard

## What Went Well

- **Systematic approach**: Created a comprehensive todo list to track all required updates
- **Thorough verification**: Used multiple grep searches to ensure no references were missed
- **Clean execution**: All documentation updates were completed without any errors
- **Command availability**: The task-manager create command was already available and functional

## What Could Be Improved

- **Initial search strategy**: Could have used a more comprehensive initial search to find all references at once
- **File structure understanding**: Had to explore the directory structure to find migration documentation
- **Historical file handling**: Initially considered updating historical task files before realizing they should remain unchanged

## Key Learnings

- **Documentation consistency is critical**: Even small command references need to be updated across all documentation for a smooth user experience
- **Historical context preservation**: Completed tasks and reflections should preserve the historical context and not be updated retroactively
- **Workflow files already updated**: The dev-handbook workflow files were already using the new command, showing good proactive documentation practices

## Technical Details

### Files Updated
1. **docs/tools.md**: Removed `task-new` flag from nav-path documentation
2. **dev-tools/docs/tools.md**: 
   - Updated AI Agent persona table to show task-manager instead of create-path
   - Removed `task-new` type from create-path documentation
   - Removed `task-new` flag from nav-path documentation
3. **dev-handbook/.meta/wfi/install-dotfiles.wf.md**: Updated validation example from `create-path task-new` to `task-manager create`

### Verification Results
- Final grep searches confirmed zero references to `create-path task-new` in active documentation
- All workflow instructions already use the new `task-manager create` command
- Migration guide did not contain any references to update

## Action Items

### Stop Doing

- Don't update historical task and reflection files when they document past states
- Avoid piecemeal searches when a comprehensive scan would be more efficient

### Continue Doing

- Use systematic todo lists for complex documentation updates
- Verify command availability before proceeding with documentation updates
- Perform comprehensive verification scans after updates

### Start Doing

- Create a documentation update checklist template for future similar tasks
- Document the distinction between active and historical documentation more clearly
- Consider automated documentation consistency checks in CI/CD

## Additional Context

- Parent task: v.0.4.0+task.017 - Add task-manager create subcommand
- This task ensures documentation consistency after the command migration
- All acceptance criteria were met successfully
